"""Pytest finds fixtures here. They live in tests/fixtures/, one file per topic, and are listed once:

    aws, fixed_clock     run around every test automatically (autouse)
    atomic_transactions  opt-in: the fake database runs one transaction at a time, like the real one
    client, auth         the API, and a signed-in Vic
    sent                 catches outgoing emails

Shared test data and shortcuts live in tests/helpers/ (builders, api shortcuts, constants).
