"""Booking rules in action: what happens when a customer asks for a time.

This layer decides WHAT should happen and in which order. It calls the shop rules (domain/shop.py)
to ask "is this a valid time?" and the database layer to actually store it. It knows nothing about
web requests or DynamoDB details, which is what keeps it easy to read and easy to test.
